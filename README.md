# filter-apply
A project written in rust that aims to provide an intuitive way to transform images with the helps of filters.
## Known Issues
To avoid overwriting, a new file is created.  However, it is saved in the same directory as the executable binary at this time.  FIX NEEDED
Also, only produces SEPIA at this time.
